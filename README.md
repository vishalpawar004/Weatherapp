🚀 Just Completed a New Project: Weather App 🌦️
I'm excited to share my latest project—a weather app built using HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. This app allows users to check the current weather conditions of any city worldwide using data fetched from a reliable weather API.
💡 Key Features:
1. Responsive Design: Built with Bootstrap to ensure the app looks great on any device.
2. Dynamic Weather Data: It fetches real-time weather data using JavaScript and displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
3. Location Search: Users can easily search for the weather in any city by typing the name in the search bar.
🛠️ Technologies Used:
1.HTML5 for the structure.
2. Bootstrap for styling and responsive design.
3. JavaScript for fetching and displaying weather data dynamically.
4. [weather-api138] for providing accurate and up-to-date weather information.
🌟 What I Learned:
This project helped me enhance my skills in:
API integration and data handling with JavaScript.
Implementing responsive design principles using Bootstrap.
